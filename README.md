Facial Recognition System with  OpenCV and TensorFlow

This project is a facial recognition system utilizing OpenCV's cascade classification algorithms for face detection and TensorFlow, primarily convolutional neural networks (CNN), to train a model for image classification or recognition of classes.

## Installation
1.Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com//FredyHoundayi/Computer-Vision-CV-Deep-Learning-DL-.git
cd Computer-Vision-CV-Deep-Learning-DL-

2.Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

3.Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1.Data Collection: Use creation_data.py to automatically collect images.

python creation_data.py

2.Model Training: Utilize TensorFlow's CNNs to train and save a model.

python model6.py

3.Recognition: Use recognition.py for real-time recognition.
python recognition.py
